# Final_Assessment

## Self Assessment
This project was a very good learning opportunity. The boodcamp was my first real coding experience and the fast pace was very challenging for me. This project was a great chance to practice techniques in a team environment with immediate feedback. Being new to data analytics, this was my first foray into machine learning. I was not able to contribute as much as I would have liked in that area. The other fields of the project like HTML and Tableau were great experience and practice for me. I need to continue to practice the skills I have become comfortable with and continue to improve in machine learning. 

## Team Assessment
This team was wonderful. It consisted of myself (Logan Murphy), Mihai Angehel, Harsh Patel, and Jill Hughes.
The team showed clear, quick, and professional communication. There were many challenges and roadblocks with our project. In the end we could not achieve the vision we had. This is a situaiton that would usually make tensions run hot. The team maintained a cohesive supportive environment and continued to strive for the best possible outcome. This is one of the strongest teams I have been a part of and I would take on any project with them.

## Project Summary
Out project was a machine learning app for image recongnition. Our end vision as to take a photo of a vehicle and identify the make, model, and year. We narrowed our focus at first to just identify if a vehicle is present. Once we had a version of this model working we moved on to the overall objective. We wanted a webpage application set up that would allow a user to drag and drop a photo then initiate the identification. While the end result has yet to be reached we hopt to continue development.
